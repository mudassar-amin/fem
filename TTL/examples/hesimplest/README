This an example progem using TTL and the half-edge data structure to create a Delaunay
triangulation. 

The program creates a Delaunay triangulation from random points in the plane, and demonstrates
how to use some of the function templates in TTL. The resulting triangulation (its edges) is
written to the file qweEdges.dat (for gnuplot or other line drawing programs) 

To compile and run the program:
- Type: make 
- Type: ./main
- To plot the datafile generated by the program with gnuplot, type: gnuplot qwe.gnu
