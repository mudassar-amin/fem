/** \page halfedge The Half-Edge Data Structure and Adaption to TTL

An implementation of the the well-known \e half-edge data structure for
triangulations is documented briefly on these pages together with
adaption of this data structure to
\ref index "TTL, The Triangulation Template Library".
Only the class hed::Dart and the
(static) struct hed::TTLtraits are documented thoroughly. These
compounds represent the interface channels between TTL and the application
data structure. See \ref api for a general documentation of this mechanism.
Follow the links to the source code for classes that are not
documented in detail - most member functions are self-explanatory.

\section heclassdiagram The Class Diagram
The classes hed::Node, hed::Edge and
hed::Triangulation represent the half-edge data structure
shown as a class diagram in the figure below. ("Edge" denotes a half-edge).
These classes, together with hed::Dart and hed::TTLtraits for adaption to TTL,
are encapsulated in the namespace \b hed.


\image html he_classdiagram.gif "Class Diagram for the Half-Edge Data Structure"


Each half-edge has a pointer to the hed::Node it starts from,
a pointer to the next half-edge belonging to the same triangle
(counterclockwise), and a pointer to its "twin-edge" belonging
to another triangle.

The class hed::Triangulation containts a list of (half-) edges, each
of which represents one triangle in the triangulation.
In addition, the class hed::Triangulation also serves as an interface
to the TTL as it implements hed::TTLtraits::swapEdge, hed::TTLtraits::splitTriangle etc.,
which are functions required on the application side by function templates
in the \ref ttl "TTL" (via the traits class).

\section example_he Example
Consult the file \ref hesimplest "main.cpp" for a program using TTL and
the half-edge data structure.
